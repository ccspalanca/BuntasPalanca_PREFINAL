# Memory Training Game
The Memory Training Game is an interactive Java-based desktop application designed to enhance a player's memory and focus. Players are presented with a grid of cards, and each round requires them to memorize and replicate an increasingly complex sequence of highlighted cards. The game begins with a simple sequence of one card, and as players successfully complete each round, the sequence length increases. If the player correctly follows the sequence, they proceed to the next round.. Otherwise, the game ends, and their performance is displayed.

# Key Features:

- Randomly generated sequences that progressively increase in difficulty.
- Real-time feedback with color-coded indicators (blue for correct input, red for incorrect).
- Easy restart option to encourage replayability.
- Responsive 3x3 grid layout for an optimal user experience.

# Purpose of the project:
- This project was developed as part of an academic exercise to demonstrate our knowledge in the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It showcases our understanding of object-oriented programming, GUI development, and event handling in Java. The game was created by <b>Gabriel Nicholas O. Buntas (Code and Presentation)</b> and <b>Carl Chester S. Palanca (Code and Debug)</b>.
